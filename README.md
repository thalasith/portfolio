# Boris' Portfolio

This is a website to showcase all of my projects and to give a bit of background information about me as a person.

## Why build this project?

Built this project to showcase my skillsets as a software engineer and a webpage for people who would like to collab with.

I also heard a lot about Astro.js and wanted to get an understanding of the new bleeding edge technology and its island architecture.

## Technology Stack

As such, below is a highlight of all the major technologies I used in this project and reasons why.

1. Framework: Astro.js
   - I chose Astro to experiment with a new technology.
   - Listening to [Fred K Schott](https://twitter.com/fredkschott?lang=en) talk about Astro.js, it sounded like the perfect framework for me.
   - The website needs to be fast, which Astro.js does by using minimal javascript.
   - The website also needs SSR for search engine optimization, which Astro.js also does as well.
   - I also liked the flexibility to pull in React components when needed.
2. Framework: React.js
   - As mentioned above, we used some React here for functionality on click.
3. CSS: Tailwind
   - Starting to become the standard for CSS as it is highly customizable
   - Is more or less unopinionated vs. MUI or Bootstrap in how you handle your CSS.

One note to mention is that I did not choose any backend for this website. The reason for this is that I had very little data to store, and for efficiency sake, it would have been overkill to have stored the data on a database and build out a website. Instead, I stored them as Javascript arrays of objects.

## Lessons

1. Learnt how to do onscroll transitions for CSS.
2. Learnt how to create logos through Canva.
3. Overall, went back to the basics with HTML and CSS which helps increase my confidence.
4. Learnt how to use Astro.js but it was very intuitive.

## Next Steps

1. Do some research on UI/UX to improve the UI/UX of the website.
